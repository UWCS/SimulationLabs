            <p> This is the boids page </p>
            
            <p> <a href="/SimulationLabs/BoidsSolutions">Task Solutions</a> </p>
            <h2> Contents </h2>

            <ul>
                <li> There's probably a bootstrap component for this... </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> What you'll create </h2>
            
            <p> The aim of this workshop is to recreate boids, which are a simulation of birds and other flocking entities (like fishes). 
                Hopefully, you'll be able to apply this in your own projects! 
                Along the way, we'll learn a little bit about p5.js, rendering, and physics.   </p>

            <div id="BoidContainer"></div>

            <em> (This is not an actual boids sketch btw - this is a random stepper) </em>

            <h2> Prerequisites </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Know how to program using a procedural language e.g. Python, Java, C#, JavaScript etc. </li>
                <li> Basic OOP i.e. you know what a class is </li>
                <li> Some physics knowledge - vectors, position, velocity, acceleration </li>
            </ul>

            <p> We will be coding in JavaScript but don't worry about knowing the ins and outs of the language; you should be able to pick it up as we go! </p>

            <h2> Introduction to p5.js </h2>
            
            We will be using JavaScript and a library called <strong> p5.js</strong>, made by the lovely <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/"> Processing Foundation</a>.
            
            <ol>
                <li> <p>To get started, create an account for the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/signup">web editor</a>.  </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Open a new sketch (File->New) </p> </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3> What is a sketch? </h3>
            <emph>Insert brief description (couple lines) on what a sketch is, and what frames are... </emph>

            <p> Your new sketch should have 2 functions: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> setup() </strong> which is a function executed once at the start </li>
                <li> <strong> draw() </strong> which is a function executed every frame (by default, about 60 times a second) </li>
            </ul>

            We create the canvas (arguments being the width and length) in <strong> setup() </strong> since we only need to do this once, and <strong>background()</strong> (which you can call with RGB colour arguments as below) is called every frame in <strong> draw()</strong>! 

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    let redV = 128; // if you're new to js, use "let" to declare variables
    let greenV = 12; 
    let blueV = 128;
    background(redV, greenV, blueV); // my favourite colour; purple!
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p> <em> If you're unfamiliar with RGB values, go <a href="/SimulationLabs/Docs/RGBValues">here</a> </em> </p>
            
            <p>This difference matters when it comes to sketches with changing elements; see the difference in the following sketches, where we draw a circle at the mouse's position every frame. One draws a background once, and the other draws a background every frame. </p>

            <h3> Circles 1 - Background Drawn Once </h3>
            
            <div id="Circles1Container"></div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(222, 222, 222); // called just once!
}

const circleSize = 10; // js also has constants!! The value of variable "circleSize" cannot be changed

function draw() {
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, circleSize);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <emph> Background is called just once - at the start - and many circles are drawn over it. </emph>
            
            <p>Note the use of <strong>mouseX</strong> and <strong>mouseY</strong> which are variables updated every frame! </p>
            
            <h3> Circles 2 - Background Drawn Every Frame </h3>
            
            <div id="Circles2Container"></div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

let circleSize = 10;

function draw() {
    background(222, 222, 222); // background drawn every frame!
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, circleSize);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <emph> Background is called every frame and essentially clears the screen by drawing the background over everything in the previous frame. </emph>


            <h3> Task: Multicolour </h3>

            We can use the <strong>stroke()</strong> and <strong>fill()</strong> functions to change the line colour and fill colour of the circles (and any shape we draw) like below:
            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
stroke(255, 0, 0); // outlines are now red!
fill(0, 255, 0); // areas are now green!
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Modify the <emph>Circles 2</emph> sketch to have colours of your choice. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Modify the <emph>Circles 1</emph> sketch to have constantly changing colour like so: </p>
            
            <div id="CirclesRainbowContainer"></div>
            
            <strong> <emph>Hint:</emph></strong> The range of colours is 0-255 (anything >255 will be interpreted as 255), so you will have to use modulus (<strong>%</strong>) or if statements to ensure RGB values don't go outside that range!
            
            <h2> Using Arrays and Objects </h2>

            <p> To store our boids, we're going to use arrays and OOP. We'll have a look at how to do this in JavaScript using a modified version of our Circles 2 sketch, to create fixed-length trails (with circles of changing size) like below: </p>

            <div id="GrowingTrailsContainer"></div>
            <em> A trail with a length of 20 circles, where the circles grow to a max size then reset </em>

            <p> 
                To create a fixed-length trail, we can't just not refresh the background every frame; this will lead to circles from before 20-circles-ago staying!
                We'll have to save the previous 20 circles, and then draw them every frame. To do this, we'll need: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>An array storing the circles </li>
                <li>An object representing a circle, which stores the position and size of the circle </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> Let's create a class for that object first! </p> 
            
            <h3> Coding the Class </h3>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
class trailCircle {
    constructor(position, size){
        this.position = position;
        this.size = size;
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p> Every class has a constructor which is the function that runs whenever an object is created; we can define the constructor for a class as above. 
                Note the use of <strong>this</strong> inside the constructor! It's a variable for the object being created.
            </p>

            <p> You might be wondering <em>what</em> position will be, since it's a single variable to represent both x and y. 
                Fortunately, p5.js provides us with the Vector class which allows us to bundle x and y into an object, and gives us a lot of methods to manipulate them as vectors!
                Have a look at the methods on the handy <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#Vector">p5 reference</a>.
                We can use the <strong>createVector()</strong> method to make one!
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>Now we can create an instance of trailCircle like so:</p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
let tc1 = new trailCircle(createVector(100,100), 100);
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>Now we can draw the object to the screen by writing:</p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
circle(tc1.position.x, tc1.position.y, tc1.size);
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>It'd be nice to put this drawing stuff into one place though, so that if we wanted to change how circles are rendered, we only need to change it in one place. 
                We might also introduce other shapes like squares, which may have a different way of rendering its shape! 
                Let's add a draw method to our class. </p>
                
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
class trailCircle {
    constructor(position, size){
        this.position = position;
        this.size = size;
    }
    
    draw(){
        circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.size);
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <h3> Storing the trail </h3>

            <p>We can declare an array for the trail and a trail length pretty easily: </p>

            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
const trails = [];
const trailLength = 20;
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p> Note <strong>const</strong> here doesn't mean an uneditable array; you can insert and remove from the array, but you can't reassign the <em>trails</em> variable to something else. 
                It will forever be that array, but you can edit the array as you wish. </p>
            
            <p> Now let's create a method updateTrail to add the current circle to the trail; we'll have a variable <em>circleSize</em> for the current size of the circle that we can reference. </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>Our method will need to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function updateTrail(){
    if(trails.length == trailLength){ // should remove one
        trails.shift(); // this deletes the first element, and shifts the rest down
    }  
    
    // create trail object to insert
    let trailObj = new trailObject(createVector(mouseX, mouseY), circleSize);
    trails.push(trailObj);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>You can see JavaScript's array methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift">here</a></p>

            Useful: use framerate to debug
