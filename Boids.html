            <p> This is the boids page </p>
            
            <p> <a href="/SimulationLabs/BoidsSolutions">Task Solutions</a> </p>
            <h2> Contents </h2>

            <ul>
                <li> There's probably a bootstrap component for this... </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> What you'll create </h2>
            
            <p> The aim of this workshop is to recreate boids, which are a simulation of birds and other flocking entities (like fishes). 
                Hopefully, you'll be able to apply this in your own projects! 
                Along the way, we'll learn a little bit about p5.js, rendering, and simulating physics. </p>

            <div id="BoidContainer"></div>

            <em> (This is not an actual boids sketch btw - this is a random stepper) </em>

            <h2> Prerequisites </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Know how to program using a procedural language e.g. Python, Java, C#, JavaScript etc. </li>
                <li> Basic OOP i.e. you know what a class is </li>
                <li> Some physics knowledge - vectors, position, velocity, acceleration </li>
            </ul>

            <p> We will be coding in JavaScript but don't worry about knowing the ins and outs of the language; you should be able to pick it up as we go! </p>

            <h2> Introduction to p5.js </h2>
            
            We will be using JavaScript and a library called <strong> p5.js</strong>, made by the lovely <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/"> Processing Foundation</a>.
            
            <ol>
                <li> <p>To get started, create an account for the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/signup">web editor</a>.  </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Open a new sketch (File->New) </p> </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3> What is a sketch? </h3>
            
            <p>A sketch is a small program that will work with p5.js to produce a simulation. 
                Just like a game, your simulation will have frames (an image of your simulation) and p5.js will aim to show 60 frames a second.
                You'll be able to code what happens just before a frame is shown, and also code what happens just before the simulation starts! 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> Your new sketch should have 2 functions: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> setup() </strong> which is a function executed once at the start </li>
                <li> <strong> draw() </strong> which is a function executed every frame </li>
            </ul>

            We create the canvas (arguments being the width and length) in <strong> setup() </strong> since we only need to do this once, and <strong>background()</strong> (which you can call with RGB colour arguments as below) is called every frame in <strong> draw()</strong>! 

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    let redV = 128; // if you're new to js, use "let" to declare variables
    let greenV = 12; 
    let blueV = 128;
    background(redV, greenV, blueV); // my favourite colour; purple!
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p> <em> If you're unfamiliar with RGB values, go <a href="/SimulationLabs/Docs/RGBValues">here</a> </em> </p>
            
            <p>This difference matters when it comes to sketches with changing elements; see the difference in the following sketches, where we draw a circle at the mouse's position every frame. One draws a background once, and the other draws a background every frame. </p>

            <h3> Circles 1 - Background Drawn Once </h3>
            
            <div id="Circles1Container"></div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(222, 222, 222); // called just once!
}

const circleSize = 10; // js also has constants!! The value of variable "circleSize" cannot be changed

function draw() {
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, circleSize);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <emph> Background is called just once - at the start - and many circles are drawn over it. </emph>
            
            <p>Note the use of <strong>mouseX</strong> and <strong>mouseY</strong> which are variables updated every frame! </p>
            
            <h3> Circles 2 - Background Drawn Every Frame </h3>
            
            <div id="Circles2Container"></div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

let circleSize = 10;

function draw() {
    background(222, 222, 222); // background drawn every frame!
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, circleSize);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <emph> Background is called every frame and essentially clears the screen by drawing the background over everything in the previous frame. </emph>


            <h3> Task: Multicolour </h3>

            We can use the <strong>stroke()</strong> and <strong>fill()</strong> functions to change the line colour and fill colour of the circles (and any shape we draw) like below:
            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
stroke(255, 0, 0); // outlines are now red!
fill(0, 255, 0); // areas are now green!
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Modify the <emph>Circles 2</emph> sketch to have colours of your choice. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Modify the <emph>Circles 1</emph> sketch to have constantly changing colour like so: </p>
            
            <div id="CirclesRainbowContainer"></div>
            
            <strong> <emph>Hint:</emph></strong> The range of colours is 0-255 (anything >255 will be interpreted as 255), so you will have to use modulus (<strong>%</strong>) or if statements to ensure RGB values don't go outside that range!
            
            <h2> Using Arrays and Objects </h2>

            <p> To store our boids, we're going to use arrays and OOP. We'll have a look at how to do this in JavaScript using a modified version of our Circles 2 sketch, to create fixed-length trails (with circles of changing size) like below: </p>

            <div id="GrowingTrailsContainer"></div>
            <em> A trail with a length of 20 circles, where the circles grow to a max size then reset </em>

            <p> 
                To create a fixed-length trail, we can't just not refresh the background every frame; this will lead to circles from before 20-circles-ago staying!
                We'll have to save the previous 20 circles, and then draw them every frame. To do this, we'll need: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>An array storing the circles </li>
                <li>An object representing a circle, which stores the position and size of the circle </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> Let's get the growing circle part out of way; this part isn't important, but the rest of the code makes less sense without it: </p>
            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

const maxCircleSize = 15;
const minCircleSize = 5;
let circleSize = 5;

function draw() {
    background(222, 222, 222); 

    // update circleSize
    circleSize++;

    if(circleSize > maxCircleSize){
        circleSize = minCircleSize;
    }

    // draw circle 
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, circleSize);
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <em>Could also use modulo to loop the circleSize, but the if statement is more readable here</em>
            
            <p>Don't worry about how this is performed; it's more important that you understand how objects, classes, and arrays work in JavaScript. </p>

            <p> Now let's create a class for the circle! </p> 
            
            <h3> Coding the Class </h3>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
class trailCircle {
    constructor(position, size){
        this.position = position;
        this.size = size;
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p> Every class has a constructor which is the function that runs whenever an object is created; we can define the constructor for a class as above. 
                Note the use of <strong>this</strong> inside the constructor! It's a variable for the object being created.
            </p>

            <p> You might be wondering <em>what</em> position will be, since it's a single variable to represent both x and y. 
                Fortunately, p5.js provides us with the Vector class which allows us to bundle x and y into an object, and gives us a lot of methods to manipulate them as vectors!
                Have a look at the methods on the handy <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#Vector">p5 reference</a>.
                We can use the <strong>createVector()</strong> method to make one!
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>Now we can create an instance of trailCircle like so:</p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
let tc1 = new trailCircle(createVector(100,100), 100);
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>Now we can draw the object to the screen by writing:</p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
circle(tc1.position.x, tc1.position.y, tc1.size);
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>It'd be nice to put this drawing stuff into one place though, so that if we wanted to change how circles are rendered, we only need to change it in one place. 
                We might also introduce other shapes like squares, which may have a different way of rendering its shape! 
                Let's add a draw method to our class. </p>
                
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
class trailCircle {
    constructor(position, size){
        this.position = position;
        this.size = size;
    }
    
    draw(){
        circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.size);
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <h3> Storing the trail </h3>

            <p>We can declare an array for the trail and a trail length pretty easily: </p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
const trails = [];
const trailLength = 20;
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p> Note <strong>const</strong> here doesn't mean an uneditable array; you can insert and remove from the array, but you can't reassign the <em>trails</em> variable to something else. 
                It will forever be that array, but you can edit the array as you wish. </p>
            
            <p> Now let's create a method updateTrail to add the current circle to the trail; remember that we have <em>circleSize</em> from the growing circle part of the sketch. </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>Our method will need to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a new trail object, and add it to the array</li>
                <li>If the array is full, then remove the oldest circle in the array</li>
            </ul>

            <p> I'll arbitrarily decide that the circles will be added to the end of the array, so therefore the oldest circles will be in the front of the array. Here's one implementation of the specification above:</p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function updateTrail(){
    if(trails.length == trailLength){ // should remove one
        trails.shift(); // this deletes the first element, and shifts the rest down
    }  
    
    // create trail object to insert
    let trailObj = new trailObject(createVector(mouseX, mouseY), circleSize);
    trails.push(trailObj);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>This might be a little confusing because of the use of <em>shift()</em> and <em>push()</em>; they're just JavaScript methods to make our lives easier. 
                
                You can see JavaScript's array methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift">here</a>!
            </p>

            <p> We do need to call updateTrail() in draw; let's call it just after we draw the current circle. </p>
            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function draw() {
    background(222, 222, 222); 

    // update circleSize
    circleSize++;

    if(circleSize > maxCircleSize){
        circleSize = minCircleSize;
    }

    // draw circle 
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, circleSize);

    // update stuff
    updateTrail();
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <em>Our updated draw method</em>
            
            <br>

            <p> Okay great, now we just need to display the trail! </p>

            <h3> Displaying the trail</h3>

            <p>All we have to do is loop through our array of trail circles and display each one. I want to draw the oldest first, so I'll iterate from the start to the end of the array. </p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function drawTrail(){
    for(let i = 0; i &lt; trails.length; i++){
        let trailObj = trails[i];
        
        // draw the circle!
        trailObj.draw();
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p> And now we'll call <em>drawTrail()</em> before the current circle (so we don't draw the trail over the current circle!) </p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
function draw() {
    background(222, 222, 222); // background drawn every frame!

    // update circleSize
    circleSize++;

    if(circleSize > maxCircleSize){
        circleSize = minCircleSize;
    }

    // draw stuff
    drawTrail();
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, circleSize);

    // update stuff
    updateTrail();
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <em>Our final version of draw()!</em>

            <h3> Full Code for Growing Trails </h3>
            
            <p> You can have a look at the full program <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/RexMortem/sketches/hJOgrWgry">here</a></p>

            <h3> Task: Rainbow Trails </h3>

            <p> With the help of the Growing Trails code, modify your solution to the task Multicolour to create rainbow trails. </p>

            <p> You should keep the colour changing code, and store the previous 10 or so circles! Your simulation should look something like this:</p>

            <div id="RainbowTrailsContainer"></div>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Once you've finished your sketch, sometimes it's a little hard to see whether the trail circles have the colour and position that they should. You can verify this more easily by slowing down your simulation! Use <em>frameRate(10)</em> in setup to set your sketch to run at 10 frames per second. </p>

            <h2> May the Force be with you </h2>
            
            <p> To make our boids move, we're going to use forces. We know from physics that $F=ma$, but we're going to simplify things by ignoring mass and jump straight to changing acceleration! </p>

            <p> Let's try modelling a simple force; a constant acceleration to the right. </p>

            <h3> Accelerating Ball </h3>

            <p> First, let's establish a class for this ball to make things clear to ourselves. </p>
            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
class Ball {
    constructor(){
        this.position = createVector(0,0);
        this.velocity = createVector(0,0);
        this.acceleration = createVector(0,0);
    }

    draw(){
        circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, 10);
    }
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p> This is all stuff we've basically done, but we also need a way to simulate all the physics. 
                From physics, we know that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and that velocity is the rate of change of position.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> So to simulate our ball's motion, we would: </p>

            <ol>
                <li> Update the velocity according to acceleration </li>
                <li> Update the position according to velocity </li>
            </ol>

            <p> As we'll soon see, we have to do this in a <em>very careful</em> way. </p>

            <h4>Enter deltaTime</h4>

            <p>Until now, we've not really considered how long each frame takes. 
            It'd be reasonable to assume each frame takes about 1/60 seconds to process <em>however</em> each frame <strong>actually</strong> takes a slightly different amount of time. When simulations get more complex, this difference in time may increase! 
            </p>
            
            <p>To test this theory, console.log the <em>deltaTime</em> variable inside the <em>draw()</em> function in a blank sketch; deltaTime will be set to the time taken to process the previous frame! You should see differences in the values logged despite not much going on.</p>
            
            <h4>Why should we care?</h4>

            <p>Imagine two different devices: device A and device B. A runs slowly and can only handle the simulation running at 20 FPS, and B runs quickly and can handle the simulation running at its intended 60 FPS.
                
                If we <em>don't</em> use deltaTime, then B will run the simulation 3 times as quickly as A! If this is a game, then A will be running the game at a third of the speed
                it's meant to be played at. Imagine playing your favourite platformer where everything is 3 times slower!
            </p>

            <p>Of course, this doesn't matter massively for simple simulations </p>

            <h4>Using deltaTime (Incorrectly)</h4>

            <p> We know acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and velocity is the rate of change of position so it'd be reasonable to write our motion simulation as: </p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
simulate(){
    velocity = velocity + (deltaTime * acceleration);
    position = position + (deltaTime * velocity);
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>Or in p5.js code:</p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-js">
simulate(){
    this.velocity.add(p5.Vector.mult(this.acceleration, deltaTime));  
    this.position.add(p5.Vector.mult(this.velocity, deltaTime));
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <em>Again, if you're confused by p5.js code, look at the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#vector">reference</a></em>
            
            <p>This looks and feels correct, but there's a slight problem! Here is a simulation using this method, with </p>
